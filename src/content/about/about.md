Excel nerd and content creator for high-performing sports teams.

**Some of my achievements:**

- Helped an underdog sports team make content people want, 34x'ed reach
- Negotiated with a tech company (>$2.5T market cap)
- hacked a \$500m data company (they raised $40m in 2020)
- made snapchat lenses for fun, got over 123m views


**Now:**
- [ ] Creating content people can't stop sharing.
- [ ] Looking to move to a big city.

I focused on [producing](https://paulgraham.com/love.html) [value by doing](https://blog.samaltman.com/value-is-created-by-doing). Turns out it's a great way to find what you love to do!
